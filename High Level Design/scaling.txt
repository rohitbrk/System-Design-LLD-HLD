Scaling refers to designing a system that can serve heavy user load without going down.
(Auto Scaling - Cloud service that monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance)

Two ways of scaling a system:
1. Horizontal scaling - Add more power (CPU, RAM, Storage etc) to the existing server
2. Vertical scaling - Add more instances of the server to the pool and distribute load among them
