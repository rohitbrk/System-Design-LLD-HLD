# Design-Patterns

This repo contains Design Patterns - examples.

Design Patterns are patterns that can be used as solutions for commonly recurring problems in software engineering.

Design Patterns can be widely divided into 3 types

1. Creational Patterns.
   Examples:
   1. Factory
   2. Builder
   3. Singleton
2. Structural Patterns.
   Examples:
   1. Facade
   2. Adapter
3. Behavioral Patterns.
   Examples:
   1. Observer/ PubSub
   2. Iterator
   3. Strategy

  
As the names suggest, 
1. Creational patterns are about creating classes so that we can scale them efficiently in future and also for code maintenance
2. Structural patterns are about structuring class/ classes and the data within them
3. Behavioural patterns are about the behaviour of class/ classes with each other
