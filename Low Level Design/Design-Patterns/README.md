# Design-Patterns

This repo contains Design Patterns - examples.

Design Patterns are patterns that can be used as solutions for commonly recurring problems in software engineering.

Design Patterns can be widely divided into 3 types

1. Behavioral Patterns.
   Examples:
   1. Observer/ PubSub
   2. Iterator
   3. Strategy
2. Creational Patterns.
   Examples:
   1. Factory
   2. Builder
   3. Singleton
3. Structural Patterns.
   Examples:
   1. Facade
   2. Adapter
  
As the names suggest, 
1. Creational patterns are about creating classes
3. Behavioural patterns are about the behaviour of class/ classes with each other
