# If you want to use a different payment gateway, youâ€™ll need to change the PaymentProcessor class. 
# To prevent this, you need to invert the dependency so that the PayPal and Stripe classes need to adapt to the PaymentProcessor class. 
# To do that, you define an interface and make the PaymentProcessor dependent on it instead of PayPal and Stripe classes
