# this principle states that -
# Clients should not be forced to depend upon methods that they do not use. 
# Interfaces belong to clients, not to hierarchies.
# If a class doesnâ€™t use particular methods or attributes, then those methods and attributes should be segregated into more specific classes.

# In the example, separate classes for BWPrinter and ColourPrinter have been defined,
# instead of defining a single Printer with both functionalities.
# If there is only one Printer class with both functionalities, we would have to deal with the error in OldPrinter,
# as it doesn't support colour printing functionality.
